            Web design is a crucial component of the web development process. If you're interested in web design, we're guessing you have a creative streak. And how could you not be excited about jumping in and making your first website? Web design is about crafting
            a functional piece of art — but where do you start? If you're wondering what you need to know before you begin, this guide will help you out.

                Choose something basic for your first site design
            </p>
            <p class="section-heading-content">
                This seems like a no brainer, right? But sometimes we can get overly ambitious and end up discouraged. For your first project, it’s a good idea to choose something simple and fun. An ecommerce site is more complicated and would be better to tackle once
                you have more experience.
                <br> A blog is a great place to start. It will be a good design exercise and you’ll learn how a Content Management System (CMS) works, which will be important to know for future site designs. Best of all — you don’t have to start from
                scratch. There are plenty of blog templates that make it easy to put one together.
                <br> Templates are a valuable learning tool. Watching how HTML, CSS, and Javascript elements are styled and come together will give you deeper insight into what makes a design work. You can use templates as a foundation to make changes
                and customizations.
                <br> Maybe you don't want to start a blog — try pulling from your creative pursuits or hobbies. How about building a showcase for your photography skills or for your collection of short stories? Creating a design to feature a passion of
                yours makes for an enjoyable first project.

                You've no doubt come across websites that have wowed you with their stunning design.
                <br> Create an inspiration doc with links to sites you love, or bookmark them as you go. Pinterest is a great place to find great site design — you can find and pins illustrations, book covers, posters, blogs, and other types of design
                work to refer to. Designers use the term "mood board" for these collections. Mood boards are a quick reference resource if you find yourself stuck. Which you will.
                <br> Outside the discoveries you make on your own, there are some curated collections you should check out.
