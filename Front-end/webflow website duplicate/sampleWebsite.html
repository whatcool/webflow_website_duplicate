                Web design is a crucial component of the web development process. If you're interested in web design, we're guessing you have a creative streak. And how could you not be excited about jumping in and making your first website? Web design is about crafting
                a functional piece of art — but where do you start? If you're wondering what you need to know before you begin, this guide will help you out.

                    <h1>
                        Choose something basic for your first site design
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This seems like a no brainer, right? But sometimes we can get overly ambitious and end up discouraged. For your first project, it’s a good idea to choose something simple and fun. An ecommerce site is more complicated and would be better to tackle once
                        you have more experience.
                        <br> A blog is a great place to start. It will be a good design exercise and you’ll learn how a Content Management System (CMS) works, which will be important to know for future site designs. Best of all — you don’t have to start
                        from scratch. There are plenty of <a href="https://webflow.com/blog-websites ">blog templates</a> that make it easy to put one together.
                        <br> Templates are a valuable learning tool. Watching how HTML, CSS, and Javascript elements are styled and come together will give you deeper insight into what makes a design work. You can use templates as a foundation to make
                        changes and customizations.
                        <br> Maybe you don't want to start a blog — try pulling from your creative pursuits or hobbies. How about building a showcase for your photography skills or for your collection of short stories? Creating a design to feature a passion
                        of yours makes for an enjoyable first project.

                        You've no doubt come across websites that have wowed you with their stunning design.
                        <br> Create an inspiration doc with links to sites you love, or bookmark them as you go. Pinterest is a great place to find great site design — you can find and pins illustrations, book covers, posters, blogs, and other types of
                        design work to refer to. Designers use the term "mood board " for these collections. Mood boards are a quick reference resource if you find yourself stuck. Which you will.
                        <br> Outside the discoveries you make on your own, there are some curated collections you should check out.
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/ ">Awwwards</a> always has new and fresh work and a variety of themed collections </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/ ">Behance</a> is a fantastic compilation of website design work, where the focus is on quality and creativity</li>

                            We often read without even being aware of typefaces. Pay attention to the effect type has on as you consume content. Is that font on the menu readable? What makes that hand-lettered sign for the local business work so well? Letters are everywhere. Make
                            note of both good and bad uses of typography.
                            <br> Typewolf is an excellent resource to keep tabs on popular fonts. It has plenty of lists to explore, a featured site of the day, and lookbooks that have spectacular font combinations. It’s helpful to see actual examples
                            of typography being used, and websites like Typewolf are a great place to see their practical applications. Getting familiar with different fonts will help you pick the right type for your first site design.

                        There are so many disciplines of design to be familiar with. A knowledge of product design, illustration, and even branding can further develop your creative senses.
                        <br> For inspiration that goes beyond web design, Abduzeedo offers brilliant examples. Whether it’s poster art, luggage, or furniture, you’ll see fantastic examples of design done right. Be open to different types of design and
                        actively seek out inspiration. The more knowledge you have, the easier it will be to design your first website. Education informs intuition.

                    <p>
                        Putting content first means having content ready to work with before you start designing your first website.
                        <br> It doesn't have to be perfect. You can always edit and optimize for Google SEO (search engine optimization) later. But having at least a rough draft of what will go live will help make sure the design is laid out to accommodate
                        it. Designing with real content gives you a better representation of how the website will look and function. It also gives you the opportunity to make changes earlier in the design process.
                        <br> For blogs, you'll need to have a post ready to test in the CMS. Having a couple posts written before you launch will save scrambling to write something after the fact.

                    Use the principles of design to guide your beginner web design process
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Effective design is guided by certain rules and it’s important to understand essential web design skills before you start. There are standard practices that will simplify the process and make for a more refined final product.
                </p>
                <div id="subheading ">
                    <h3>
                        Layout
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to design and build websites, understanding good layout is key. We suggest keeping things minimal and working with only a few elements to focus on the perfect placement.
                        <br> When you first start designing, think grids. Grids align elements, like div blocks and images on a web page, in a way that creates order.
                        <br> The structure of a layout should follow a visual hierarchy. What are the important ideas you want people to see and in what order? Visual hierarchy needs to adhere to the common patterns people use when reading. There are
                        two paths people’s eyes generally follow on the web: the F-pattern and the Z-pattern. Being familiar with how these patterns work will help you organize your own content.
                        <br> The F-pattern is more common for designs with dense blocks of content. People’s eyes will scan down the left side of a layout until things catch their attention and then read from left to right. Imagine looking through the
                        menu at a restaurant — you may skip over the bold names of dishes aligned on the left until you come to something that grabs you, which will prompt you to read the supporting details explaining that specific dish.
                        <br> Most people will read through something like a blog post in this F-pattern. With left-aligned text and bulleted sentences, Nelson Abalos takes advantage of this design technique, making his posts easy to navigate and follow.
                    </p>
                    <!--Picture-->
                    <p>
                        The Z-pattern is associated with less text-heavy design. Many landing pages conform to this pattern. All the major elements on the Conservation Guide site adhere to the Z-pattern. If you’re a beginner web designer, this is a simple layout trick to help
                        usability.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div id="subheading ">
                    <h3>
                        Color
                    </h3>
                    <!--Picture-->
                    <p>
                        You have the colors of the rainbow and beyond available to you. And we all know that "with great power comes great responsibility. " The power of the color picker can be wielded for good or evil.
                        <br> Here are a couple straightforward approaches in choosing a color scheme for your first website.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="subheading ">
                    <h3>
                        Monochrome
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Use a single color as the base, vary the amount of saturation, include lights and darks, and play with various hues for a uniform color scheme. Regardless of your niche, a monochrome site is a smart design choice. And remember, whatever color you choose
                        for the text, make sure you’re thoughtful about readability.
                        <br> In this example from Unique, each section is delineated by a monochromatic color scheme. You don’t have to get this fancy in your beginner designs, but it’s nice to see their use of different monochromatic color variations.
                        Notice how each section is made of colors related to the featured bags? This is a nice design trick that makes for a harmonious color scheme.
                    </p>
                    <!--Picture-->
                </div>
                <div id="subheading ">
                    <h3>
                        Complementary
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Take colors that are opposite on the color wheel and combine them. Easy enough, right?
                        <br> Use complementary colors with care. In this design below from the Ignisis website, the designer used blue and orange in different combinations along with whitespace and greys for a layout that never tires the eyes. The contrast
                        feels crisp and refreshing.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="subheading ">
                    <h3>
                        Typography
                    </h3>
                    <p id="typography ">
                        Typography is two-dimensional architecture, based on experience and imagination, and guided by rules and readability.
